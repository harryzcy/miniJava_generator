# miniJava_generator

Self explanatory, generates miniJava files.

# Todo
- include miniJava methods
- add digits into identifiers
- maybe clean up the random identifier stuff...choose from dictionary of words, etc. want it to encompass entire possible input though!
- write main function to export created programs as file with name formatted as "TestXXX.mjava" where XXX are three digits with leading zeros
- finish implementation, to speak generally
